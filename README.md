# Immutability in blockchain

In this project, I'm testing out how immutability works in blockchain. 

To test this out if you're interest, you can download the project or fork it. Once you run the project in the terminal, you'll see a few transactions that are hardcoded into the program similar to how the blockchain has a record of previous transactions. 
When you first run the program, it will list the previous transactions and the hashes. Try changing the transactions in (t1, t2, t3, and t4) and compare the previous hashes with the new ones. 
You'll notice the hashes on the previous blocks change, but if you restore the transactions to the way they we're, it's back to its original hash. This is what makes blockchain useful. Once someone changes anything, the integrity is compromised.
